Fall 2020 UW Madison CS736 Project 3 scripts

This is the code we wrote for our final project.

sock_traf.bt traces recv and send system calls.
thread_timing.bt traces a particular thread group's usage of popular system calls.
profile_threads.sh calls thread_timing.bt with various thread group names.
syscalls.bt determines the most popular syscalls and most prominent thread groups.
